// Streaming-safe stripper for model-emitted literal ACP render tags (#206).
// Compressed history is rendered to the model as render tags; models sometimes
// imitate them in visible output ("tag echo"), the client replays the echoed
// tags on later turns, and the imitation amplifies into unbounded repetition.
// Stripping render tags from outgoing text breaks the loop at the source.
//
// The imitation has two shapes. The plain one is a copy of the rendered form
// (an opening with its attributes, a ref inside, a close); the wrapped one puts
// the model's whole turn, its tool call included, where the opening's
// attributes are still open, so no close is ever written and regex matching
// alone cannot see the span (see BROKEN_ATTRS, SWALLOW_CAP). Both end the same
// way: the span is swallowed, never handed to the client as orphan markup.
// ONLY the render form (\x3c<name> attrs…\x3e, \x3c<name …/\x3e, \x3c/<name>\x3e) is stripped —
// the underscore-namespaced text-protocol triggers (\x3cacp_compress\x3e etc.) and
// ordinary prose containing \x3c pass through untouched.
// #673: models typo the 3-letter name when imitating (observed: acip/acpi,
// including mixed correct-open + typo'd-close), so <name> matches a bounded
// mutation set instead of the exact spelling: the three core letters in any
// order, plus at most ONE extra letter drawn from that set or an inserted i.
// #1731: and the set folds case — models drift casing too, and uppercase
// echoes (\x3cACP …\x3e, \x3c/ACP\x3e) leaked verbatim because every name pattern was a
// lowercase literal. The folding is baked into the alternation itself as
// per-letter character classes rather than an `i` flag, so the .source-based
// reconstructions below (stripAcpTags, flush) stay behavior-identical: a
// flag would be silently dropped at every rebuild site. Every match still
// requires the name to be followed by \s or > (attrs or close), so real
// words that merely contain the letters (acpi/acpi.h includes, caption, app)
// never match; an angle-bracketed bare token like \x3cACPI\x3e is indistinguishable
// from a casing-drifted tag and is stripped, same trade as its lowercase form.
// A false positive costs at most the same bounded caps as before
// (swallow ≤ SWALLOW_CAP, hold ≤ HOLD_LIMIT/TAG_OPEN_CAP).

// input_json_delta.partial_json and tool_use.input, responses

// BYTE-EXACT. Never route it through any filter from this file, at fragment
// or whole-payload granularity, and never "clean" it because it contains a
// tag-shaped echo. A shape-based filter cannot distinguish a model-echoed
// render tag from a literal the user genuinely wants written (bash command
// strings, write/edit file contents): stripping arguments silently corrupts
// executed/persisted data (#1039). Echoed tags surfacing in a host TUI is
// cosmetic noise; that fix belongs on the injection side (host renderTags
// policy, #933), never here. The strippers below apply to model PROSE only
