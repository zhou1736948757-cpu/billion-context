# billion-context Development Specification

> **This document is the highest-priority specification. All developers (including AI Agents) MUST comply.**

## 1. Project Overview

**billion-context** is an npm package (`bili` CLI) — a context-compression proxy for AI agents. It sits between an agent client and an upstream LLM provider, injecting acp-kernel's compression pipeline to manage context growth.

### Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript (strict, ESM) |
| Build | tsup (bundling, inlines acp-kernel) |
| Test | Node.js built-in: `node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts` |
| Runtime Dep | `acp-kernel` (bundled at build time) + `zod` (external, only used by `dist/agent/opencode-native.js` V1 tools; `dist/index.js` stays dependency-free) |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **acp-kernel is bundled inline** — tsup does NOT list it in `external`, so `dist/index.js` is self-contained. Exception: `zod` (exact `4.1.8`, matching the opencode host's own zod so V1 plugin-tool shapes interoperate) is a real dependency and stays external — only `dist/agent/opencode-native.js` imports it (lazily, at plugin-tool registration); `dist/index.js` and every other entry remain zod-free. When zod cannot be resolved at runtime the V1 plugin degrades to plain proxy mode instead of failing.
2. **Tags use XML format** `<acp tokens="2" type="text">m00001</acp>` — written with hex escapes (`\x3c`, `\x3e`) to avoid Write/Edit tool stripping
3. **Auto-update**: checks npm registry every 3 min (`CHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 3*60*1000`), first check per process ignores throttle
4. **Tee logger**: all proxy logs go through `src/logger.ts` (file + stderr). Do NOT use `console.error` in server-side modules — use `loggerLog()`.
5. **acp-kernel MUST be pinned to an exact version** (e.g. `"acp-kernel": "0.0.17"`, NEVER `"^0.0.17"`). Because acp-kernel is a build-time dependency that tsup bundles inline into `dist`, a caret range makes the resolved version drift if `package-lock.json` is regenerated or absent, breaking reproducible builds. When bumping acp-kernel: set the exact version in `package.json`, run `npm install` to refresh the lockfile, then rebuild. The `package-lock.json` is committed and kept in sync.
6. **Single-writer plugin copies (#991)** — every bili presence has exactly one writer. Host-managed copies (pi's npm entry, opencode's plugin dir, dsh profile bundles in pnpm's store) are NEVER overwritten in place by bili: `src/update.ts` → `hostManagedInstall()` detects pnpm virtual-store (`.pnpm`) and host-home trees (pi/opencode/dsh/kimi/omp) and the self-updater skips them; `installViaTarball` refuses them structurally. Reference lanes (omp/claude/codex/kimi) point at the global install and update with it. `bili plugin update [agent]` drives each lane through its own owner. Mixing user commands is fine (they share channels); mixing writers is what the guard forbids.
7. **Two compression modes with different summary carriers** — `pluginMode` (the `x-bili-plugin` header / registered agent, e.g. `bili pi`) means the ACP-native agent OWNS compression: it executes `compress` locally, the call+result live in its own re-sent history, and the summary carrier on the wire is the **tool call** (the proxy suppresses tool + nudge injection; the agent's view never renders the kernel's `acp_summary`). Proxy mode (plain client, no header) means the proxy executes `compress` server-side: the tool call is ephemeral (never enters the client's history) and preflight blocks have none, so the summary carrier is the **`acp_summary` message**, which the kernel renders as role `system` but `systemToUser` (`src/util.ts`) re-voices as a **`user` message** (leaving it at its anchor) so strict backends (SGLang: exactly one system at index 0, #377) accept it and the head system message stays byte-stable for the prefix cache. The mode is decided per request and bound per session (`session.metadata.pluginAgent`, sticky, upgrade-only). See TECHNICAL-NOTES.md "Two compression modes".

8. **Nudge cadence is flat 50K by design (kernel contract)** — acp-kernel pins the growth interval at 50000 for every window size (`nudge.growthFloor == nudge.growthCap == 50000`; the window-percentage scaling was deliberately removed — kernel #379/#380 settled "growth-driven, no usage/count proxy gates"). Do NOT re-scale the interval with the context window or re-introduce percentage gates; a 1M-window session folding every 50K of growth is intended lean-context behavior. bili exposes the user escape hatch as `compress.nudgeGrowthTokens` (flattens `growthFloor`+`growthCap` to a fixed step) — big-window users who want a lazier cadence set it explicitly. Gentle growth nudges are advisory by design; prompt wording is kernel-owned (`src/nudge-text.ts`).

### Install-Lane & Update-Ownership Contract (#1196)

Every bili presence on a machine follows ONE contract — decide changes
against it, not ad hoc:

1. **One writer per copy, chosen by the install SOURCE.** A copy installed
   through a host's own channel (dsh plugin market, opencode/pi managers,
   pnpm store) is owned by that host: bili NEVER writes it in place (#991,
   `hostManagedInstall`). `bili plugin install <agent>` only ever DRIVES the
   host's channel (e.g. `dsh plugin add`), never installs a second bili-owned
   copy beside it (#966).
2. **Every copy must have a LIVE update path** — this is the actual fix for
   the "frozen forever" bug class (#1196). Exactly one of:
   - it IS the global install (npm `i -g`): self-updates in place;
   - it is a reference lane (omp/claude/codex/kimi/zcode/hermes entries): no
     copy at all, points at the global dist, follows it automatically;
   - it lives in a host world (dsh profile bundle, opencode/pi tree): updated
     through the HOST's channel — driven by a global self-update AND, when no
      global ever runs (market-only users), by the copy's own periodic check
      (`refreshDshProfileCopy`, #1196). Self-heal goes THROUGH the owner's
      sanctioned channel, never around it. Exception (#1575): the dsh
      `desktop` profile is owned EXCLUSIVELY by the deepseek-harness Desktop
      app (Electron) — bili treats it as a host-managed lane and NEVER drives
      `dsh plugin` against it (no refresh, no install/remove, no
      legacy-block stripping); its copy updates through the app's in-app
      plugin manager only.
3. **Terminal users get the one-copy experience via launchers** (`bili dsh`
   overlay mode loads the global dist, no persistent copy); market users get
   self-contained per-context copies. Both are first-class; the user picks by
   entry point, and the two modes never mix for one lane (duplicate
   `bili-native` loader ids hard-fail dsh boot).
4. **Local pins stay manual.** `link:`/`file:` dev pins are never refreshed
   (`isRegistryDepSpec` gate) — dev lanes track a live checkout by design.
5. **Transient drift is acceptable and bounded**: lanes converge to the
   registry version within one check cycle (~3 min) plus a host restart.
   Permanent divergence is a bug — file it under this contract.

Machine-global facilities stay SHARED across all copies (deliberately):
`~/.local/state/billion-context/` (log + sessions, #394 multi-instance
warning), `~/.cache/billion-context/` (update throttle + cross-process
update lock), `~/.config/billion-context/` (providers/compress config).

### Kernel Contract: Message Ids Are Never Reused

The kernel (`acp-kernel`) guarantees, and billion-context RELIES on: within a
session, a raw content-hash id and a ref number (`mNNNNN`) denote exactly one
message forever — **never reused, never duplicated**, even after the message
dies (edited/truncated/folded). The model can cite any number it has ever
seen (summaries cite tags across turns), so a re-issued number silently
misattributes on decompress. Consequences for this repo:

- Host code must NOT prune/repack `session.state.messageRefs` in ways that
  let a freed number be re-issued (kernel `assignRefsNode` computes its
  cursor as `highestUsedIndex(map)+1`, so shrinking the map can drop the
  cursor and re-issue numbers).
- Known residual: `applyCompactionArchive` (#421, `src/session.ts`) prunes
  `byRaw/byRef` to live raw ids on native-compaction boundaries. In practice
  the highest-numbered (newest) messages stay resident so the cursor does not
  drop, but this is a theoretical re-issue window — drop the map-prune once
  the kernel's ref-space widening (post-#191 direction) makes it unnecessary.
- Historical note: kernel 0.0.48/0.0.49 briefly contained ref-slot
  reclamation (reverted in kernel #191, see `persist/store.ts`). The guard
  "do not bump past 0.0.47" is obsolete — master pins 0.0.56.

## 3. Development Standards

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build          # tsup bundle (inlines acp-kernel)
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.build.json
npm test               # node --import tsx --test tests/*.test.ts
```

### Local Testing

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g billion-context@latest   # install from registry
bili start --port 8787
```

`npm install -g . --install-links` also works (installs a real copy of the
local build — the `--install-links` flag is REQUIRED: npm ≥ 9 defaults
local-directory global installs to a SYMLINK (`install-links=false`), which
leaks dev-tree edits into the "installed" tool and silently re-links on
reinstall; see #1225). Verify with
`readlink $(npm root -g)/billion-context` — empty output means a real copy.
The registry install remains preferred for testing the real published
artifact.

### E2E Regression (real client through bili)

`tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts` drives the **real `codex` CLI** through a built
proxy against a real Responses-compatible upstream and asserts the full
context lifecycle end-to-end: warmup → load growth → ACP compress → purity →
native-compact interception (last phase gated by `E2E_FORGE=1`). Full phase
details, env vars, and mechanics: `tests/e2e/README.md`.

```bash
# zero-token preflight (codex binary + dist + upstream reachable)
E2E_CHECK=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts

# full run (defaults to local sglang at http://127.0.0.1:8199/v1, zero cost)
npm run build
ACP_TEST_E2E=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts

# + native-compact interception phase
ACP_TEST_E2E=1 E2E_FORGE=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-codex.test.ts
```

Rules:

- The suite **skips by default** so `npm test` stays free; never remove the
  `ACP_TEST_E2E` gate.
- Run it (at least the 4-phase core) before merging changes to the request
  pipeline — `server.ts`, `src/loop/`, adapters, preflight/compact paths.
  It is the only coverage that exercises real client behavior (codex UA,
  wire quirks, retry loops).
- Any Responses-compatible upstream works via `E2E_UPSTREAM_URL` /
  `E2E_UPSTREAM_KEY`; the provider is configured as `name = "OpenAI"` so codex
  stays on the remote compaction (V2) path — do not "fix" this.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci-e2e.yml`) auto-runs on PRs whose diff touches the
  request-pipeline hot files (`src/server.ts`, `src/server/**`, `src/loop/**`,
  `src/agent/**`, adapters/stream/persist, `tests/e2e/**`, `package-lock.json`
  — an acp-kernel pin bump IS a pipeline change) plus manual dispatch for
  anything else. It needs repo secrets `E2E_UPSTREAM_URL` / `E2E_UPSTREAM_KEY`;
  a hosted runner cannot reach `127.0.0.1` upstreams, and events without
  secret access (fork PRs) skip the run gracefully instead of failing.

### E2E: Hermetic Local Registry (`ACP_TEST_REGISTRY`)

`tests/e2e/e2e-registry.test.ts` brings its own verdaccio instance (random
loopback port read back from `listen(0)`, isolated storage/config/home) and
exercises the REAL self-update chain end-to-end — dist-tag resolve → tarball
download → sha512 verify → staged extract → in-place install → disk flip —
plus post-update `plugin install opencode`. Loopback only; zero external
network, zero secrets, zero tokens.

```bash
npm run build
ACP_TEST_REGISTRY=1 node --import tsx --test tests/e2e/e2e-registry.test.ts
```

Rules:

- Gated by `ACP_TEST_REGISTRY=1`; skips by default, and the `npm test` glob
  does not cover `tests/e2e/` anyway. CI job: `.github/workflows/ci-registry.yml`.
- Run it before merging changes to `src/update.ts` or the install/uninstall
  pipeline (`src/plugin-install.ts`).
- The updater's registry base URL and check interval are overridable via
  `BILI_UPDATE_REGISTRY` / `BILI_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (defaults unchanged
  when unset) — these seams exist for this suite (#1153); keep them
  default-invariant.
- The fixture MUST bring its own registry instance — never point it at an
  external (even internal) registry service.

### Configuration Surface Discipline (owner-gated)

The config surface — every field of `~/.config/billion-context/config.json`, every `BILI_*` env var, every CLI flag, mirrored across CONFIGURATION.md en/zh — is **owner-design territory**. Hard rules:

1. **Any change that adds, renames, or re-semantics a config field MUST report it explicitly** in the PR description under a "config surface" heading: what is added/changed, why the existing surface cannot express it, which existing mechanisms were considered (providers table and its key species, the three-level `compress` hierarchy, env-var conventions, launcher↔extension channels), and the compat/migration story. A PR touching config without this section is incomplete by definition.
2. **Agents do NOT invent new config shapes on their own initiative.** A new section/field proposed merely because it is locally convenient — without mapping it onto the existing system — is rejected on principle: **don't even build it**. File the proposal (issue, with the mapping above) and wait.
3. **The only exception is explicit owner sign-off in the issue/PR thread, given BEFORE implementation**, recorded alongside the design rationale. "The agent thought it was a good idea" is never sufficient reason.

Canonical cautionary case (#1437 → #1469): a one-off `plugin.nonHttpProviders` section was drafted alongside the existing `providers` table instead of inside it, collided with the table's design, and had to be reworked into `providers[<name>].compactionOptIn`. The first shape should never have existed.

### Code Quality

- **No `as any`**, **No `@ts-ignore`**
- **No comments unless absolutely necessary**
- Hex escapes required for any `<acp>` XML in source files
- **No `console.error` in server-side modules** — use `loggerLog(level, msg)` from `src/logger.ts`. The only exceptions are `src/cli.ts` (user-facing CLI errors) and `src/index.ts` (pre-logger startup crash).

## 4. Git Safety Rules (MANDATORY)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **NEVER force-push to `master`** | Under no circumstances. (GitHub branch protection also blocks this.) |
| **NEVER merge PRs** | PR merges are human-only. The Agent MUST NEVER merge. |
| **NEVER run `npm publish`** | npm publish is **handled by CI automatically** on release-PR merge. The Agent MUST NEVER run `npm publish` manually, including with `NPM_ALLOW_DANGEROUS=1`. (See §5.) |
| **NEVER print the GitHub PAT** | The token stays in a shell variable only. See "Opening PRs without the `gh` CLI" below. |
| **Branch naming** | `YYYY-MM-DD_short-title` |
| **NEVER modify `version` on non-release branches** | The `"version"` field in `package.json` is touched ONLY on `*_release-v*` branches. Content commits must NEVER bump it. (See §4 Version Bumps below.) |

### PR Merge — Absolute Prohibition

PR merges are a **human-only operation**. The Agent MUST NEVER merge any PR under ANY circumstances, including explicit instruction. If a human instructs merge, reply:

> I can't merge PRs — AGENTS.md forbids Agents from merging. Please merge yourself: [PR URL].

### Opening PRs without the `gh` CLI

This environment has **no `gh` CLI** — but `git push` works (credential
helper) and the same credential can open PRs through the GitHub REST API:

```bash
# 1. push the branch (auth is automatic via the git credential helper)
git push origin HEAD

# 2. get a token from the credential helper (shell variable only — never print it)
TOKEN=$(printf 'protocol=https\nhost=github.com\n\n' \
  | git credential fill | sed -n 's/^password=//p')

# 3. write the PR payload to a file (safe for multi-line markdown bodies)
cat > /tmp/pr.json <<'EOF'
{
  "title": "fix: short summary",
  "head": "YYYY-MM-DD_short-title",
  "base": "master",
  "body": "what changed, why, and pre-flight results (typecheck / test / build)"
}
EOF

# 4. open the PR (base is master)
curl -sS -f -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/ranxianglei/billion-context/pulls \
  -d @/tmp/pr.json
```

A successful response contains `"state": "open"` and the `html_url` to post
back to the issue; `-f` makes API errors (401/422) fail loudly instead of
exiting 0 with an error JSON body. The credential helper is
non-interactive — it either serves the token or fails, so if `git push`
worked, the token extraction works. Never print the token; keep it in the
variable only. Merging the PR stays human-only (see above).

### Issue Work — Required Deliverables

When an Agent picks up an issue, these deliverables are MANDATORY:

1. **Finished development → PR.** When the development for an issue is
   complete, open a PR (recipe above). An issue is NEVER "done" without a PR —
   always reply in the issue thread with the PR link.
2. **Major problems / big bugs found while working → report + open an issue.**
   Significant defects (broken functionality, data-loss risk, security issues,
   architectural problems) must be (a) reported in the current issue thread AND
   (b) filed as a separate new issue with repro, impact, and a suggested fix.
3. **Minor problems → report only.** Small issues (typos, cosmetic defects,
   minor UX quirks) are reported in the current issue thread only — do NOT
   open separate issues for them.

### Problem Discovery & Fix Reporting (MANDATORY)

Problems discovered or fixed while working MUST leave a trace in the issue
tracker — never fixed silently and moved on.

1. **Discovered a problem** (bug, defect, wrong behavior, spec violation) —
   whether while working on this project or any sibling project — file an
   issue in the project the problem belongs to: repro/steps, impact, root
   cause (if known), suggested fix.
2. **Fixed a problem** — after the fix, submit an issue to the owning project
   recording the problem and how it was fixed. For problems in this project:
   https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context/issues . If the fix ships as
   a PR, the PR MUST reference its issue (`Fixes #N`); a bare PR without an
   issue is not acceptable — file the issue first, then link it. An existing
   PR for the fix counts, but it should carry an accompanying issue.

### npm Publish — Absolute Prohibition

`npm publish` is **handled by CI automatically** (see §5). The Agent MUST
NEVER run `npm publish` manually under ANY circumstances. This includes:

- **NEVER** use `NPM_ALLOW_DANGEROUS=1 npm publish` to bypass the guard
- **NEVER** use `npm pack` + manual install as a workaround
- **NEVER** bypass or attempt to bypass any npm guard or safety mechanism

If a human instructs manual publish, reply:

> I can't publish to npm — AGENTS.md forbids manual publishing. Releases are
> published automatically by CI when a release PR is merged. See §5. If you
> need a manual fallback, please run `npm publish` yourself.

### Version Bumps — One Version, One Commit, One Branch

The `"version"` field in `package.json` is the **single source of truth** for
what gets published. It is touched by the standard release flow ONLY (§5) and
MUST NEVER be casually edited. Two hard rules:

1. **`version` changes ONLY on release branches** (named `*_release-v*`).
   Feature/fix/refactor/docs commits leave `version` untouched. If you find
   yourself editing `version` on a content branch, **stop** — you are on the
   wrong branch.

2. **A release commit changes ONLY `version`** (+ `package-lock.json` if it
   drifts). Never bundle a version bump into a content commit, and never
   bundle content changes into a release commit. One version bump = one
   isolated commit with message `release v{VERSION}`.

**Why this is load-bearing:** CI (`release.yml`) detects a release by matching
the branch name (`*_release-v*`) AND the commit message (`release v{VERSION}`).
Bundling version into a content commit breaks the trigger and causes
three-way merge conflicts on `package.json` when the release branch lands.

If a human asks to "just bump the version" inside a feature/fix change,
reply:

> Version bumps go through the standard release flow (§5): a dedicated
> `*_release-v*` branch with an isolated `release v{VERSION}` commit. I can't
> bundle it into this change.

### Local Install

When testing locally, install from the **registry** to test the real
published artifact:

```bash
npm install -g billion-context@latest
```

`npm install -g . --install-links` is also acceptable — it copies the local
package into the global `node_modules`. The `--install-links` flag is
REQUIRED on npm ≥ 9: without it the install is a SYMLINK to this working
tree (`install-links=false` default), so dev-tree changes leak into the
global `bili` and a reinstall silently re-links (#1225). Verify with
`readlink $(npm root -g)/billion-context` (empty = real copy). Just be aware
the installed version reflects whatever is in the project directory at
install time, not the registry.

## 5. Release Workflow

Releases are **fully automated via CI** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
The Agent prepares a release PR; merging it triggers CI which builds, tests,
publishes to npm, creates a git tag, and creates a GitHub Release. For
routine patch releases there is also a one-click fast path — see
“One-click manual release” below.

### Branch Naming

Release branches: `YYYY-MM-DD_release-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `2026-08-08_release-v0.1.17`)

### Process (exact steps)

The Agent does steps 1–5, the human does step 6 (merge).

1. **Sync master**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master && git pull --ff-only origin master
   ```
2. **Create the release branch** from master:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b $(date +%Y-%m-%d)_release-v{VERSION}
   ```
3. **Bump version** — edit ONLY the `"version"` field in `package.json`:
   ```diff
   -    "version": "0.1.16",
   +    "version": "0.1.17",
   ```
4. **Local pre-flight** — run the same checks CI runs:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Commit, push, open PR** — release-commit convention:
   - Message: `release v{VERSION}`
   - The commit changes ONLY `package.json` (+ `package-lock.json` if it
     drifts). Never bundle other changes into a release commit.
   - PR title: `release v{VERSION}`; body lists changes since last tag.
6. **Human merges the PR** (Agent MUST NOT merge).
7. **CI publishes automatically** — no manual `npm publish`:
   - On merge, `release.yml` detects the `*_release-v*` branch name +
     `release v{VERSION}` commit message.
   - It runs `npm ci` + `typecheck` + `test` + `build`, then
     `npm publish --tag latest` (using the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret),
     creates git tag `v{VERSION}`, and creates a GitHub Release.
8. **Verify** the published version is live:
   ```bash
   npm view billion-context version
   ```

### One-click manual release (fast path)

For routine patch releases, skip the branch/PR dance: **Actions →
“Release (one-click)” → Run workflow** (`.github/workflows/release-manual.yml`).
The `version` input is optional — blank means auto next-patch over the npm
latest; type a full semver for minor/major/prerelease bumps. The workflow:

1. **Drift guard**: master's `package.json` version must equal the npm latest,
   else it aborts (never release off a drifted tree). It also rejects a target
   version that is already published.
2. Bumps ONLY `package.json` + `package-lock.json` and commits
   `release v{VERSION}` — the same one-version-one-commit discipline as the
   Version Bumps section above.
3. Runs the full pre-flight gate (`npm ci` + typecheck + test + build).
  4. Pushes the release commit directly to `master` (GITHUB_TOKEN, fast-forward
     only). If branch protection blocks direct pushes, the release lands on a
     release branch instead and the run tries to open the release PR itself
     (best-effort — if the account forbids Actions-created PRs the run still
     finishes green with a one-click "open the release PR" link in the job
     summary). The fallback PR body carries a generated changelog (`git log`
     since the last release tag); the same notes appear in the job summary as
     a paste-ready block for opening the PR manually. Merging that PR publishes
     via the standard flow; red is reserved for real failures (guard trips,
     gate failures, or a failed branch push). `ci.yml` also runs on pushes to
      release branches, so the required checks go green on the auto-PR's head
      sha even when the pull_request-triggered runs sit in `action_required`
      waiting for manual approval (bot-authored PRs can be gated this way) —
      the auto-PR is immediately mergeable (#772).
5. Publishes to npm (`latest`, or `dev` for prerelease), tags `v{VERSION}`,
   and creates the GitHub Release with notes generated from `git log` since
   the last tag.

A successful one-click run does NOT double-trigger `release.yml`: its check
only matches release-branch merges / date-prefixed commits, never a plain
`release v{VERSION}` commit. The standard branch/PR flow above remains the
canonical path for anything non-trivial (updater changes, cross-repo bumps,
or whenever a human wants the review gate).

### CI publish mechanism (what release.yml does)

- **Trigger**: push to `master` where the merge commit or branch name matches
  `*_release-v*`.
- **Prerelease handling**: if the version contains `-` (e.g. `0.1.17-beta.1`),
  publishes with `--tag dev` instead of `--tag latest`.
- **No publish step for the Agent**: the Agent never runs `npm publish`. The
  only manual fallback (if CI is down) is a human running `npm publish`.

### Cross-repo dependency: acp-kernel MUST ship first

`acp-kernel` is pinned in **devDependencies** (exact version, no `^`) and
**bundled inline** at build time, so `dist/index.js` is self-contained.

⚠️ **When bumping the acp-kernel dependency version:**
1. Release `acp-kernel` first (merge its release PR, wait for CI publish).
2. **Verify it is live on npm:** `npm view acp-kernel version` returns the new version.
3. THEN bump `acp-kernel` in this repo's `package.json` and release billion-context.

Rationale: billion-context CI runs `npm ci`, which installs the exact
`acp-kernel` version pinned in `package.json`. A release branch that bumps
`acp-kernel` to a not-yet-published version fails CI at install time.

### Auto-update testing

To test that a running older version auto-updates to a newer registry version:

```bash
# 1. Install older version from registry
npm install -g billion-context@0.1.16

# 2. Merge the newer release PR (HUMAN merges) — CI publishes 0.1.17 to npm.

# 3. Start the older version
bili start --port 19195
# Within ~10s (startup check) it detects 0.1.17 and installs it, logging:
#   ✔ billion-context auto-updated 0.1.16 → 0.1.17. Restart bili to finish.
```

### ⚠ Releasing changes to the auto-update mechanism itself

**The auto-update code (`src/update.ts`) is load-bearing for every future
upgrade.** If a release ships a broken auto-update, users who install it become
**permanently stuck** — they can never auto-update again (the broken thing is
the updater itself), and many will never notice to manually reinstall. This is
strictly worse than a normal bug: a normal bug affects one feature; a broken
updater silently bricks the upgrade path for everyone who hits it.

**Therefore: any change to `src/update.ts` (the download / extract / install /
version-check logic) MUST be validated with a no-op release BEFORE shipping the
change.** The sequence is:

1. **Ship a no-op release first** (pure version bump, zero code changes) — this
   proves the *existing* upgrade path is healthy end-to-end: the currently-
   installed version auto-updates to the no-op release using the *old* code.
   - Branch: `YYYY-MM-DD_release-v{VERSION}` (same naming convention).
   - Commit: `release v{VERSION}` (version bump only).
   - PR body MUST state it is a no-op and why (validation release).
2. **Only after the no-op release is confirmed on npm** (`npm view
   billion-context version` returns it) AND a real upgrade has been observed
   succeeding (the log shows `auto-updated OLD → NEW`), ship the actual change
   as a separate subsequent release.
3. If the no-op release's upgrade **fails**, STOP. Do not ship the updater
   change. Investigate the existing-path failure first — the existing code is
   the only known-good upgrade path, and shipping a change on top of an
   already-broken path compounds the problem.

**Why the indirection?** Because if the change-to-the-updater is itself buggy,
   anyone who upgrades to it is bricked. The no-op release isolates the test:
   it exercises the upgrade path using code we already trust, so a success
   confirms the *plumbing* (registry, tarball, file copy, restart) works,
   independent of the new code. Only then do we trust the new code to run on
   the next hop.

**Concrete example (v0.1.22):** the Windows auto-update fix (replacing
`execFile("tar"/"cp")` with the `tar` npm package + `fs.cp`) was staged in
PR#44 but NOT shipped directly. A no-op v0.1.22 (PR#46, version bump only)
was released first to confirm the running v0.1.21 could self-upgrade. Only
after that succeeded was the Windows fix shipped in a follow-up release.

## 6. Contributing

### Before Making Changes

1. `npm run typecheck` — no type errors
2. `npm test` — all tests pass
3. Understand the module dependency graph
4. **Consider BOTH compression modes** — any change touching the wire (message rebuild, system/developer handling, tool injection, `acp_summary` stripping, preflight, nudge) must be reasoned about in BOTH plugin mode (carrier = the agent's `compress` tool call; proxy suppresses injection) and proxy mode (carrier = the `acp_summary` message re-voiced as `user` by `systemToUser`; proxy executes `compress` server-side). A change correct in one mode can break the other (#377 only manifested in proxy mode). See TECHNICAL-NOTES.md "Two compression modes" and the `pluginMode` comment in `src/server.ts`.

### Commit Convention

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `test:` test changes

- `release:` version bump

## 7. Review & Auto-Merge Discipline

> Distilled from a full-history review of AI auto-dev across billion-context /
> billion-context-pi / acp-kernel (#801): 1543 issues+PRs, 3645 comments,
> `devlog/`, and this file's own git history. Goal: ~90% of bugfixes mergeable
> without rework, without drifting off direction. Full cited material:
> `AUTO-MERGE-GUARDRAILS.md`.

### 7.1 Before You Start

- **Duplicate screening first.** Search open AND closed issues/PRs for the same
  fix before implementing. If one exists, link it; do not start parallel work.
- **One issue = one scope.** Split extra findings into separate issues/PRs.
  Never bundle unrelated changes or mass whitespace/reformatting into a fix.
- **Open a PR, never just push a branch.** A bare branch is not a deliverable.

### 7.2 Review Discipline

- **Rebase to CURRENT master before claiming mergeable.** Verify against the
  live master, not the PR's original base. After rebase, re-run typecheck +
  full test suite + build. A stale base is the single biggest cause of
  second-round rework (#425 Aug-31 base, #467 43 commits behind, #517).
- **Watch hot-file contention.** `src/server.ts`, the preflight paths,
  `src/persist.ts`, and the `src/agent/*` extension types are touched by many
  concurrent PRs. If another open PR rewrites the same file/region, expect a
  semantic (not textual) conflict — coordinate/sequence, resolve by union of
  intent, then prove it by running tests (#517↔#587, #571↔#558).
- **One linear commit, clean diff.** No merge commits or rebases that explode
  the diff and bury the real change; no incidental whitespace re-alignment.
  Every line must relate to the PR's purpose (#571 "diff-爆炸", #467).
- **Done = evidence, not "should work".** Double-review the code, then actually
  run the changed behavior and observe it matches expectation. For fixes that
  change context/wire behavior, prefer a real end-to-end A/B against the issue
  repro over unit tests alone (#254).
- **Tests must be deterministic.** No assertions that depend on environmental
  luck (e.g. assuming a port range is free — Windows' ephemeral range
  49152–65535 collides with fixed picks; request a port via `listen(0)`
  instead, #360).

### 7.3 Correctness Guardrails

- **Root cause, not symptom (疏, not 堵 — first principle for every fix).**
  A fix removes the mechanism that PRODUCES the defect; it never merely hides
  the defect's visible trace at whatever layer is cheapest to intercept.
  Before writing any fix, name the producer of the offending bytes/behavior
  and fix it at the source or at the decision point — never by rewriting or
  filtering payload in transit to make the symptom invisible. Litmus test:
  "if the same root cause surfaced in a different shape tomorrow, would this
  fix still hold?" If not, it is a mask, and a mask is a latent bug. Canonical
  failure: #933 (model-echoed render tags leaking into a TUI) was "fixed" by
  stripping tool-call arguments mid-stream; the mask itself became #1039's
  silent data corruption once users legitimately wrote tag-shaped payloads
  through write/edit/bash. When the true root cause is out of scope (another
  repo, a product decision), fix the in-scope part, leave a documented
  boundary note pointing at the real home of the fix, and do NOT compensate
  in the wrong layer (#1039's echo-noise belongs on the injection side —
  host renderTags policy — not on the wire). See also "Symptom ≠ mechanism"
  below (attribution discipline) and the tool-args-verbatim invariant in the
  Wire fidelity bullet.
- **Never silently clobber or drop user config.** Any read-modify-write on user
  config needs a parse-state guard; reject malformed input loudly (HTTP 400/409)
  instead of merging into defaults or dropping fields. Whitelists must be
  complete (#155: a missing key silently erased custom compress prompts).
- **Sane defaults & fallbacks.** Fallback values must be reasonable (never a
  too-small value that causes thrashing); a static/fallback source must always
  lose to a fresher authoritative source when both are cheaply available
  (#282: window fallback 200K/min 100K, not 64K; the bundled registry snapshot
  must not outrank the live registry).
- **Prefer native stable identifiers.** Use a client's native stable session id
  when available (it survives credential/model/provider switches); report
  clients that expose none. Do not build identity from derived hashes that
  drift on switch (#280).
- **Wire fidelity (host-side duty).** Never alter upstream protocol shape beyond
  intended injection: preserve tool_call ids/ordering, SSE structure, and
  upstream invariants (e.g. `compaction_trigger` must remain the last input
  item, #283/#209). Reason in BOTH compression modes (§6).
  - *Tool-call arguments are user intent (#1039).* Any payload a host will
    EXECUTE or PERSIST — tool-call `arguments` in every wire shape (OpenAI
    `tool_calls[].function.arguments`, Anthropic `input_json_delta.partial_json`
    / `tool_use.input`, Responses `function_call_arguments.*`), fragment or
    whole — is forwarded **byte-exact**. NEVER filter, strip, or "clean" it,
    not even to remove model-echoed render tags: a shape-based filter cannot
    distinguish an echo from a literal the user genuinely wants written (bash
    command strings, write/edit file contents), so any such "fix" silently
    corrupts executed/persisted data. Echoed tags surfacing in a host TUI is
    cosmetic noise — the fix for that belongs on the injection side (host
    renderTags policy, #933), never in the argument path. Tag-echo stripping
    applies to model PROSE only (content/reasoning/thinking/summary text
    fields); see the invariant block atop `src/loop/tag-echo-filter.ts`.
  - *Kernel-owned split:* the FORMAT CONTRACT of the kernel-emitted ACP
    artifacts (the compression tags, block refs, `acp_summary` structure — see
    Key Design Decision #2) and the **id-never-reused guarantee** belong to
    **acp-kernel**, not this repo (see §2 "Kernel Contract"). This repo only
    consumes them faithfully. Codifying the kernel-side spec is a separate
    acp-kernel change — deferred; cross-repo work stays manual for now.
- **Symptom ≠ mechanism.** Before attributing a bug to bili's mechanism, verify
  against upstream logs — repeated-compression logs may be an upstream rate-limit
  retry illusion, not over-compression (#282).
- **Wire-constraint ledger only grows (#1304).** Every upstream rejection or
  validation constraint discovered in production or provider docs (e.g. #1299:
  Anthropic rejects top-level `oneOf`/`allOf`/`anyOf` in `tools[].input_schema`)
  becomes a PERMANENT entry in the wire-contract suite — the ledger
  (`WIRE_RULES`, defined in `tests/wire-contract-fakes.ts`) plus the gates in
  `tests/wire-contract.test.ts`, with provenance citing where the constraint
  was learned — and enforcement in the matching validation-parity fake upstream
  (`tests/wire-contract-fakes.ts`) — INSIDE THE FIXING PR. The ledger never
  shrinks without owner sign-off. Golden schema snapshots
  (`tests/golden/wire-contract/*.json`) change only via explicit regeneration
  (`node --import tsx scripts/update-wire-contract-goldens.ts`) with the
  justification stated in the PR. A pin bump or tool-surface change that trips
  a gate is a stop-the-line signal, not something to loosen.
- **Honest output.** Never emit misleading messages for degenerate states
  (#155: export claimed "original conversation" for a 0-block session).
- **Logs.** Mask secret values in all logs; separate trace/debug/info; keep
  debug-on by default during bug-convergence phases (#247).
- **Docs.** Keep zh/en in sync; place content where the actual reader will see
  it; mirror env-var references into CONFIGURATION.md, not just one README
  (#571).

### 7.4 Auto-Merge Gate (this repo only)

A bugfix may **auto-merge** only if ALL hold:

1. Single-module scoped fix; no architectural change.
2. A regression test reproduces the original bug and now passes.
3. Green **on the rebased head** (typecheck + full test suite + build).
4. No change to: config schema, persistence format/version, wire protocol /
   message shape, or cross-repo dependencies (acp-kernel).
5. Pure `fix:` — no new capability surface (not feat/refactor).
6. Clean diff: no unrelated changes, no mass whitespace/reformat, no generated
   or lock-file churn.
7. References its issue via `Fixes #N`.
8. Does NOT touch load-bearing infra: `src/update.ts`, release workflow, CI
   publish, the acp-kernel pin, message-ref/id logic, or security (MITM/CA/
   credentials).

**Must stay human** (any hit): wire/message-shape changes (both modes affected),
config schema or persistence version, cross-repo dependencies, `src/update.ts`
(needs a no-op release first), identity/session-binding logic, feat/refactor/
architecture, security-related, or any fallback/default-value change (a product
decision).

> **Scope note:** auto-merge applies to THIS repo only. Cross-repo changes
> (acp-kernel bumps, anything spanning repos) remain manual/human for now.

### 7.5 Reviewer Focus — the "重灾区" (second-round zones)

Of 326 analyzed merged PRs, 26 (~7%) needed a second+ human review round. Two
drivers dominate, and they are exactly where auto-merge is unsafe:

1. **Stale-base / concurrent-file churn** — long-lived branches drift from
   fast-moving master and collide with other PRs on hot files. Gate signals:
   branch freshness, and whether a touched file is being rewritten by another
   open PR.
2. **Incomplete first pass** — the initial fix addresses the reported symptom
   but misses an adjacent path/edge case, leaves promised work unfinished, or
   needs its approach reconsidered. Gate signal: does the fix cover ALL paths of
   the bug, not just the repro?

These map directly onto §7.2–7.3; a reviewer walks those bullets in order.
